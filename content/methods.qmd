Detail sonobuoy methods here, provide links to info. Also include
summaries/links to papers (thode, miller, navy project, ASCR info, etc)

## Field Methods

Sonobuoys are expendable drifting recorders housed in a compact cylinder
for deployment from ships or airplanes. When the buoys are deployed, the
hydrophone drops to a pre-determined depth and a float inflates at the
surface. The multi-plexed signal containing the audio and DIFAR
information is transmitted from an antenna embedded in the float; this
signal can be received using a VHF receiver. Specialized receivers are
required to obtain the full low-frequency audio, and specialized
software is required to demultiplex the DIFAR signal. Field methods have
evolved over the years from analog to digital formats, and a summary of
current field methods (as of 2019) can be found in

## Playback Experiment and Methods Development

In 2016, SWFSC conducted a playback experiment for the purpose of
estimating the precision and accuracy of bearing angle estimation. This
was part of a larger Navy-funded project to investigate the potential
for using sonobuoys as a tool to estimate cetacean density in offshore
waters (\[Rankin et al.
2017(https://github.com/SAEL-SWFSC/SWFSC-PAM-Sonobuoys/tree/main/supplement/Rankin_SBFinalReport_Rep2017.pdf)\]).
This data has been useful for methods development on several projects,
and this data is publicly available for future projects ([Link to NCEI
Data Portal](https://doi.org/10.25921/s2dw-2h15)).

### Acoustic Spatial Capture Recapture

SWFSC collaborated with [Ben Stevenson (University of
Aukland)](https://profiles.auckland.ac.nz/ben-stevenson/about) to
evaluate the potential use of Acoustic Spatial Capture Recapture (ASCR)
methods to estimate call density across clustered sonobuoys. While a
simulation suggested these methods should be feasible, application to
real data identified a number of complications and errors that precluded
adoption of ASCR for these cases. Links to summaries of the [sonobuoy
SCR
models](https://github.com/SAEL-SWFSC/SWFSC-PAM-Sonobuoys/tree/main/supplement/stevenson_SCRsonobuoys_summary2017.pdf)
and [application to real
data](https://github.com/SAEL-SWFSC/SWFSC-PAM-Sonobuoys/tree/main/supplement/stevenson_SCRcalcurceas_summary2017.pdf).

#### Azigram Displays for DIFAR Sonobuoys

As part of a larger methods paper led by [Aaron Thode (Scripps
Institution of Oceanography)](https://athode.scrippsprofiles.ucsd.edu/),
this playback data provided a means of testing the capabilities of using
Azigrams to enhance the accuracy of bearing measurements of weak
frequency-modulated signals. See [Thode et al.
2019](https://pubs.aip.org/asa/jasa/article/146/1/95/997205) for more
information.

### Estimating Sonobuoy Drift

![](images/Miller_drift_Fig1.jpeg){width="308"}

We attached GPS to each of the four sonobuoys during the playback
experiment, which provided high resolution tracking. This data provided
a valuable dataset to test new methods for estimating sonobuoy drift
developed by \[Brian Miller of the Australian Marine Mammal
Center\](<https://www.marinemammals.gov.au/about/staff-and-students/brian-miller/>).
See [Miller et al.
2018](https://pubs.aip.org/asa/jasa/article/143/1/EL25/616424) for more
information.
