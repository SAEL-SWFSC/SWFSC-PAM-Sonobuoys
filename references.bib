	abstract = {The International Whaling Commission (IWC) carried out blue whale research within its annual Southern Ocean Whale and Ecosystem Research (SOWER) cruises between 1996 and 2010. Over 700 sonobuoys were deployed to record blue whale vocalisations during 11 Antarctic and three low‐latitude blue whale cruises off Australia, Madagascar and Chile. The recorded acoustic files from Antarctic deployments were collated and reviewed to develop a database of digital acoustic files and the associated deployment station metadata of 7,486 acoustic files from 484 stations. Acoustic files were analysed using the automated detection template and visual verification method. We found a significant difference between the total number of acoustic recording hours (2,481) reported in the associated cruise reports and the currently available number of acoustic recording hours (1,541). Antarctic blue whale vocalisations (9,315 D‐calls and 24,902 Z‐calls) were detected on 4,183 out of the total 7,486 acoustic files. December had the lowest call rates; January and February yielded high call rates. While most sonobuoys (63\%) were deployed between 1800hrs and 0600hrs, the majority of calls (62\%) were detected during observation periods between 0600hrs and 1800hrs. The difference between the available and reported data is a significant concern. Reconciliation of these and any future IWC acoustic data is strongly recommended.},

	abstract = {The AN/SSQ-53 Directional Frequency Analysis and Recording (DIFAR) sonobuoy is an expendable device that can derive acoustic particle velocity along two orthogonal horizontal axes, along with acoustic pressure. This information enables computation of azimuths of low-frequency acoustic sources from a single compact sensor. The standard approach for estimating azimuth from these sensors is by conventional beamforming (i.e., adding weighted time series), but the resulting “cardioid” beampattern is imprecise, computationally expensive, and vulnerable to directional noise contamination for weak signals. Demonstrated here is an alternative multiplicative processing scheme that computes the “active intensity” of an acoustic signal to obtain the dominant directionality of a noise field as a function of time and frequency. This information is conveniently displayed as an “azigram,” which is analogous to a spectrogram, but uses color to indicate azimuth instead of intensity. Data from several locations demonstrate this approach, which can be computed without demultiplexing the raw signal. Azigrams have been used to help diagnose sonobuoy issues, improve detectability, and estimate bearings of low signal-to-noise ratio signals. Azigrams may also enhance the detection and potential classification of signals embedded in directional noise fields.},

Scientists from the Australian Antarctic Division conducted acoustic monitoring for marine mammals during Legs 2 and 3 of the ACE voyage, from Hobart, Australia to Punta Arenas, Chile, and from Punta Arenas, Chile to Cape Town, South Africa. The main goal of this passive acoustic survey was to locate meso-scale aggregations of calling blue and fin whales. During the voyage, directional sonobuoys were used to conduct 301 listening stations along the voyage track, and these stations yielded 492 hours of acoustic recordings. Calls from blue and fin whales were detected in real time during the voyage, and calibrated measurements of the bearing and intensity of these calls were obtained for each detection. 21,641 calls from Antarctic blue whales were detected at 274 listening stations, while 912 calls from fin whales were detected at 34 listening stations throughout the voyage. Although not the main focus of the project, monitoring also took place for sperm whale, humpback whale, Antarctic minke whale, leopard seal, crabeater seal, and odontocete (whistle) vocalisations during each listening station. The passive acoustic data collected during this voyage will allow investigation of aspects of the distribution of Antarctic blue whales and the properties of their acoustic signals including: source levels of Antarctic blue whale calls, environmental drivers of blue whale distribution, and potential changes in the distribution of Antarctic blue whales over time.},

	abstract = {Automatic classification of fin, sei, and blue whale frequency modulated downsweeps has been a challenging task for bioacousticians. These calls overlap in frequency range and have similar time durations. The traditional spectrogram methodology, the Short Time Fourier Transform, tends to be ineffective because of the large temporal ambiguities needed to achieve the necessary frequency resolution to study the fine time-frequency (TF) structures. Spectrograms generated with the Pseudo Wigner-Ville Distribution (PWVD) provide much higher simultaneous TF resolution compared with the traditional method. The PWVD allows bioacousticians to study the fine TF structures of the sound, such as the instantaneous frequency, instantaneous bandwidth, contour slope, etc. These features set the foundation of identifying sounds that are usually considered difficult to discriminate using the traditional method. Wigner-Ville distribution of the baleen whale downsweeps showed distinguishable characteristics; for example, the TF contour of fin and sei whales exhibited concave and convex shapes, which have never been reported in the literature. A Support Vector Machine classifier was trained and tested based on the parameters extracted from the PWVD.},

	abstract = {1 Blue whale locations in the Southern Hemisphere and northern Indian Ocean were obtained from catches (303 239), sightings (4383 records of ≥8058 whales), strandings (103), Discovery marks (2191) and recoveries (95), and acoustic recordings. 2 Sighting surveys included 7 480 450 km of effort plus 14 676 days with unmeasured effort. Groups usually consisted of solitary whales (65.2\%) or pairs (24.6\%); larger feeding aggregations of unassociated individuals were only rarely observed. Sighting rates (groups per 1000 km from many platform types) varied by four orders of magnitude and were lowest in the waters of Brazil, South Africa, the eastern tropical Pacific, Antarctica and South Georgia; higher in the Subantarctic and Peru; and highest around Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Chile, southern Australia and south of Madagascar. 3 Blue whales avoid the oligotrophic central gyres of the Indian, Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, but are more common where phytoplankton densities are high, and where there are dynamic oceanographic processes like upwelling and frontal meandering. 4 Compared with historical catches, the Antarctic (‘true’) subspecies is exceedingly rare and usually concentrated closer to the summer pack ice. In summer they are found throughout the Antarctic; in winter they migrate to southern Africa (although recent sightings there are rare) and to other northerly locations (based on acoustics), although some overwinter in the Antarctic. 5 Pygmy blue whales are found around the Indian Ocean and from southern Australia to New Zealand. At least four groupings are evident: northern Indian Ocean, from Madagascar to the Subantarctic, Indonesia to western and southern Australia, and from New Zealand northwards to the equator. Sighting rates are typically much higher than for Antarctic blue whales. 6 South-east Pacific blue whales have a discrete distribution and high sighting rates compared with the Antarctic. Further work is needed to clarify their subspecific status given their distinctive genetics, acoustics and length frequencies. 7 Antarctic blue whales numbered 1700 (95\% Bayesian interval 860–2900) in 1996 (less than 1\% of original levels), but are increasing at 7.3\% per annum (95\% Bayesian interval 1.4–11.6\%). The status of other populations in the Southern Hemisphere and northern Indian Ocean is unknown because few abundance estimates are available, but higher recent sighting rates suggest that they are less depleted than Antarctic blue whales.},

Over the 40-day period, this whale moved throughout a large part of the southeast Bering Sea shelf, including areas of the outer-shelf where right whales have not been seen in decades. In September, multiple right whales were acoustically located and subsequently sighted by another survey vessel approaching a near-real-time position from the tag. An analysis of photographs confirmed at least 17 individual whales (not including the tagged whales). Genetic analysis of biopsy samples identified 17 individuals: 10 males and 7 females. The discovery of seven females was significant, as only one female had been identified in the past. Genetics also confirmed the presence of at least two calves. Although the future of this population is highly uncertain, the discovery of additional females and calves gives some hope that this most critically endangered of all whale populations may still possess the capacity to recover.},

	abstract = {Stereotypical calls of baleen whales can be a diagnostic field characteristic for determining species and stocks. Repeated series of these calls may be used for long‐term population studies using passive acoustics. Vocalizations were recorded from 15 groups of blue whales (consisting of 42 individuals) during the 2001–02 and 2002–03 International Whaling Commission‐Southern Ocean Whale and Ecosystem Research (IWC‐SOWER) surveys in Antarctic waters north and east of the Ross Sea. Long‐duration vocalizations attributed to Antarctic blue whales included 28‐Hz ‘‘tones,’’ 28 Hz ‘‘downsweeps,’’ and the more complex ‘‘3‐unit’’ calls (considered to be song units). The 28‐Hz component was stable for all three calls, regardless of signal strength. The 3‐unit calls varied in their 2nd and 3rd units and were heard in only 10 out of the 15 groups. There was no evidence of repeated patterns (song phrases) of 3‐unit calls. The results of this study suggest that the 28‐Hz peak frequency may be used as a diagnostic feature for acoustic identification of Antarctic blue whales in the field. Additional research on the gender, group size, and associated behavior of these animals is necessary to ground‐truth long‐term acoustic population studies of baleen whales.},
