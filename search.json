We want to create this collection so that reproducing the results is straightforward.\nBecause PAM data is naturally very large data– we do NOT want to save our raw acoustic data here. We do recommend that your research compendium provide information on accessing this raw data. This is valuable for others, and for Future You.\nThis research compendium is set up to create an HTML output (not necessarily a word doc or pdf).",

Below is an example fail-point where a required package cannot be found\n\n\nEdit Basic Workflow\nOne solution to this error is to include your additional packages in the basic render-and-publish.yml workflow.\n\nOpen your render-and-publish.yml workflow file\nIdentify the following lines (should be around line 17 & 18)\n  - name: Install packages (needed for Rmd)\n    run: Rscript -e 'install.packages(c(\"rmarkdown\", \"knitr\", \"jsonlite\"))'\nAdd packages to the list on the second line\n\nExample:\n    run: Rscript -e 'install.packages(c(\"rmarkdown\", \"knitr\", \"jsonlite\", \"dplyr\"))'\n\nCommit the changes and your workflow should re-run without errors\n\n\n\nUsing renv Workflow\nIf you are still encountering package errors you may need to set up a renv workflow in your R project. This will manage the package dependencies and ensure the proper packages are installed and loaded for rendered GitHub pages.\n\nMake sure you have an R project open for your repository and initialize renv in the project by running the following code renv::init() (you may need to install the renv package). This will create a locale renv folder and a renv.lock file with the packages you loaded\nInstall and load any additional packages, every time you add a new package you will need to add them to your project’s renv.lock file by running the following code renv::snapshot()\nUse .github/workflows/render-and-publish-with-code.yml as your default GitHub pages actions workflow\n\nFrom your repository, rename .github/workflows/render-and-publish.yml to render-and-publish.yml.disabled. Save file\nFrom your repository, rename .github/workflows/render-and-publish-with-code.yml.disabled to render-and-publish-with-code.yml. Save file\nSave and push all changes to GitHub, make sure the new renv files are pushed. render-and-publish-with-code.yml should be the only workflow to run when changes are made to the repository",
