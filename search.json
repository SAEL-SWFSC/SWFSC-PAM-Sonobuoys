You can click on the failed workflow to identify where the action failed. Below is an example fail-point where a required package cannot be found\n\n\nEdit Basic Workflow\nOne solution to this error is to include your additional packages in the basic render-and-publish.yml workflow.\n\nOpen your render-and-publish.yml workflow file\nIdentify the following lines (should be around line 17 & 18)\n  - name: Install packages (needed for Rmd)\n    run: Rscript -e 'install.packages(c(\"rmarkdown\", \"knitr\", \"jsonlite\"))'\nAdd packages to the list on the second line\n\nExample:\n    run: Rscript -e 'install.packages(c(\"rmarkdown\", \"knitr\", \"jsonlite\", \"dplyr\"))'\n\nCommit the changes and your workflow should re-run without errors\n\n\n\nUsing renv Workflow\nIf you are still encountering package errors you may need to set up a renv workflow in your R project. This will manage the package dependencies and ensure the proper packages are installed and loaded for rendered GitHub pages.\n\nMake sure you have an R project open for your repository and initialize renv in the project by running the following code renv::init() (you may need to install the renv package). This will create a locale renv folder and a renv.lock file with the packages you loaded\nInstall and load any additional packages, every time you add a new package you will need to add them to your project’s renv.lock file by running the following code renv::snapshot()\nUse .github/workflows/render-and-publish-with-code.yml as your default GitHub pages actions workflow\n\nFrom your repository, rename .github/workflows/render-and-publish.yml to render-and-publish.yml.disabled. Save file\nFrom your repository, rename .github/workflows/render-and-publish-with-code.yml.disabled to render-and-publish-with-code.yml. Save file\nSave and push all changes to GitHub, make sure the new renv files are pushed. render-and-publish-with-code.yml should be the only workflow to run when changes are made to the repository"

    "text": "Field Methods\nSonobuoys are expendable drifting recorders housed in a compact cylinder for deployment from ships or airplanes. When the buoys are deployed, the hydrophone drops to a pre-determined depth and a float inflates at the surface. The multi-plexed signal containing the audio and DIFAR information is transmitted from an antenna embedded in the float; this signal can be received using a VHF receiver. Specialized receivers are required to obtain the full low-frequency audio, and specialized software is required to demultiplex the DIFAR signal. Field methods have evolved over the years from analog to digital formats, and a summary of current field methods (as of 2019) can be found in [@rankin]",

    "text": "Playback Experiment and Methods Development\nIn 2016, SWFSC conducted a playback experiment for the purpose of estimating the precision and accuracy of bearing angle estimation. This was part of a larger Navy-funded project to investigate the potential for using sonobuoys as a tool to estimate cetacean density in offshore waters ([Rankin et al. 2017(https://github.com/SAEL-SWFSC/SWFSC-PAM-Sonobuoys/tree/main/supplement/Rankin_SBFinalReport_Rep2017.pdf)]). This data has been useful for methods development on several projects, and this data is publicly available for future projects (Link to NCEI Data Portal).\n\nAcoustic Spatial Capture Recapture\n\nSWFSC collaborated with Ben Stevenson (University of Aukland) to evaluate the potential use of Acoustic Spatial Capture Recapture (ASCR) methods to estimate call density across clustered sonobuoys. While a simulation suggested these methods should be feasible, application to real data identified a number of complications and errors that precluded adoption of ASCR for these cases. Links to summaries of the sonobuoy SCR models and application to real data.\n\nAzigram Displays for DIFAR Sonobuoys\n\nAs part of a larger methods paper led by Aaron Thode (Scripps Institution of Oceanography), this playback data provided a means of testing the capabilities of using Azigrams to enhance the accuracy of bearing measurements of weak frequency-modulated signals. See Thode et al. 2019 for more information.\n\n\n\nEstimating Sonobuoy Drift\n\nWe attached GPS to each of the four sonobuoys during the playback experiment, which provided high resolution tracking. This data provided a valuable dataset to test new methods for estimating sonobuoy drift developed by [Brian Miller of the Australian Marine Mammal Center](https://www.marinemammals.gov.au/about/staff-and-students/brian-miller/). See Miller et al. 2018 for more information.",
